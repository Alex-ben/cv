            Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer".
            Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer,
            the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more complex
            electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern
            computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine. His varied
            work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent"
            among the many polymaths of his century.
